# Agony SFX
SPT client mod that allows bots to play additional voice lines upon dying.

# Overview
This mod adds a chance for characters to play OnAgony sound effects when they die.

# Background
In live EFT, characters play either OnAgony or OnDeath sound effects upon dying, regardless of the type of damage received. However, in SPT, OnAgony effects only trigger from specific damage types like grenade or bleedout. This mod adjusts that behavior, giving OnAgony a 50% chance to play upon death, regardless of damage type, to better mimic live EFT. 

# Install
Extract directly into SPT folder.
