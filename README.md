# Overview
This mod adds a chance for characters to play OnAgony sound effects when they die.

# Background
Currently live EFT, characters play either OnAgony or OnDeath sound effects upon dying, regardless of the type of damage received. However, in SPT, OnAgony effects only trigger from specific damage types like grenade or bleedout. This mod adjusts that behavior, giving OnAgony a configurable chance (Default at 50%) to play upon death, regardless of damage type, to better mimic live EFT.

# Specifics
For weapon-induced damage types like bullets and melee, the mod will roll a chance to decide whether to play OnDeath or OnAgony sounds. The chance is adjustable via the in-game F12 menu.
For non-weapon-induced damage types, status effects such as light/heavy bleeding, exhaustion, or explosion will cause OnAgony to always play.


# Install
Extract directly into SPT folder.
